Nate Silver's K is $$\\text{K}=20\\frac{(\\text{MOV}_{winner}+3)^{0.8}}{7.5+0.006(\\text{elo_difference}_{winner})}.$$ where $$\\text{elo difference}_{winner}=\\text{winning_elo}-\\text{losing_elo}.$$ Nate also takes into account home advantage by increasing the rating of the home team by 100 as in $R_{\\text{home}}=R_\\text{team}+100$. \n",

# Overview

Install steps for [FuseDream](https://github.com/gnobitab/FuseDream) as of 12/8/2021. My GPU too small, I think you need 16GB of GPU memory, so shelving this for now but I hope this helps someone.

```
conda create -n image_generation_with_fuse_dream python=3.7
conda activate image_generation_with_fuse_dream
git clone https://github.com/gnobitab/FuseDream.git

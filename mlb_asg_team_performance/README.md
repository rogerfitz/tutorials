Read https://www.ergosum.co/visualizing-team-records-all-star-break for the full writeup.  
[Data](https://github.com/rogerfitz/tutorials/blob/master/mlb_asg_team_performance/static/data/paracoord_asg_vals.csv) from baseball-reference. Playoff and pennant information missing from 20+ years ago as I only used http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/ as my source. Full world series information available.  
Made with d3.js, https://syntagmatic.github.io/parallel-coordinates/, and slickgrid

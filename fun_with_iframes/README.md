Browsers these days are limiting the power of the world wide web by strictly enforcing how content can be viewed. Namely through the use of policies like the [Same-origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy), restricting the ability of web developers to create web sites that allow multiple external sites to be controlled from one browser "window".  
Examples:  

- ![](Spotify_30_seconds_only.PNG?raw=true)   
- ![](youtube_content_restricted.PNG?raw=true)  
- ![](spotify_iframe_error.PNG?raw=true)
  
### What Can We Do?
The cool thing is that we should be able to turn off this "security" policy and create a new class web applications.  
You can fix the both issues with [this chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ignore-x-frame-headers/gleekbfjekiniecknbkamfmkohkpodhe/reviews). MORE COMING SOON and an example "cool" webapp utilizing iframes.

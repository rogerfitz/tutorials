ha1sjlq,"Mind explaining what you mean by “incredible impact on water conservation” ? I know cows drink a lot of water, but it simply gets urinated out and then evaporated back in the atmosphere to be rained back on the ground. It’s the water cycle most people see in like 3rd grade.

Also, I’m pretty sure those numbers include the so called “green water”, I.e. the water that would naturally rain on the soils with or without the presence of cattle. A friend of mine is a dairy farmer and his cows drink around 100 liter of water a day, and closer to 200 on really hot days, so 50 gallons is a very high estimate for drinking alone.

I really doubt your local drought is caused by cows.

According to this BC government website, cows only need up to 12 gal of drinking water a day.

https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/agriculture-and-seafood/agricultural-land-and-environment/water/livestock-watering/590301-1_livestock_water_requirements.pdf",-3,p9wdlq,3
ha1vpuv,"I got those numbers from a few sources:


>[A milking dairy cow drinks about 30 to 50 gallons of water each day. During periods of heat stress water intake may double.](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/drinking_water_for_dairy_cattle_part_1)

>[As a rule of thumb, consumption will range from 1 gallon per 100 pounds of body weight during cold weather to nearly 2 gallons per 100 pounds of body during the hottest weather.](https://beef.unl.edu/amountwatercowsdrink)

>[A University of Georgia publication lists the estimated water requirements for cattle in different production stages when the daily high temperature is 90 degrees F. The data suggest for cattle in this environmental condition, a growing animal or a lactating cow needs two gallons of water per 100 pounds of body weight. A nonlactating cow or bull LLneeds one gallon of water per 100 pounds of body weight. As an example, spring-calving cows will need close to 20 to 24 gallons of water per day for themselves and another 5 to 10 gallons for their calf in these high temperature environmental conditions. Remember, some of the water will come from the feed they eat and/or vegetative grass which is high in water content. Also, for the nursing calf, a portion of the daily water needs will come from the dam’s milk.](https://beef.unl.edu/water-requirements-for-beef-cattle)

So maybe not 30-50 gallons per day, but more like 15-50 gal per day depending on the conditions and size of the cattle.

Edit: Also, I'm mean to infer that cattle are causing a drought, that would just be a ridiculous statement. However, during a severe drought, cattle farmers seem to be one of highest sources of wasted water. People shit on Nestle (not that they shouldn't) for bottling and selling water at basically no cost, while not batting an eye that singular cattle ranchers get that same deal. What I'm ultimately getting at, is in times of drought, ranching should be one of the first places that make a cut. Make them pay for the water they use. Instead, we just pay the ranchers to not use the water. Either way, the outcome is a reduction in cattle consuming water.",14,p9wdlq,4

That being said, reducing methane would have a ""cooling"" effect. 

Additionally, 80-90% of the food eaten by cows is agricultural by-product that humans can't eat. PLUS they tend to graze on grasslands that cant support food growth for humans. Of course, the Amazon being cut down to make room for grazing livestock is horrible.

This is just a useless ""positive"" fact to share about methane. We are constantly increasing our methane in the atmosphere every year, every bit that returns to the planet after its 12 year cycle is put back out and increased. 

So to act like this is positive or somehow makes beef not that harmful is absurd. We're pumping out a constant amount of it, increasing it every year, it doesn't matter that some is now coming back, if we keep pumping more back out.

Third, you say you don’t separate the calf. You want people to make the big industries down so you can compete. I assume you sell their milk, if you eat them at the end of their life, per your words. Why are you not separating their child at birth then, since the calf would need milk from their mother, taking down the profits you can make. Is it compassion for the animals? And if it, where does compassion go when you eat them at the end of their life? Would you accept (hypothetically of course) to be killed at the end of your life so someone could eat you? So your meat doesn’t go in vain? Because that’s how it works? (Hypothetically again) Also, cows average a birth rate of 1.06 males, so let’s call it 50/50.

You send them to kill at their teens or young adulthood. You don’t kill them at the end of their life, more like at when they’re most profitable. Yet, that’s not exploiting. /s

Tell me how veganism kills more animals than omnivore then, and I’ll tie the sustainability in here cause this is a sustainability sub after all. For every pound of meat, you need at least 8 pounds of plants produced. For cows this number is much larger. So if you kill X number of animals producing 1 pound of “vegan food”, you would kill X * 8(up to 25) animals per pound of meat plus the animal you’re killing and eating with intention. Also, not to mention the water and land usage. Yet again, try to tell me how it kills more. I’d like to be proven wrong, yet you’ve yet to show me any fact or study or well thought out response other than “stupid vegans”.",3,p9wdlq,17
haihsah,"Eating animals is not exploiting them, cuz it's natural, go look outside and you will see it all day. My chickens eat bugs, are they exploiting worms?

You realize conmbines kill a shit load of rodents, birds and bugs right? And all of those row crops use way more water. For example, nut crops use 139 and 180 liters per gram of protein, cow is 112.

haj6zv9,"Like u/jonahhillfanaccount said, your animals eat produced crops, and other bugs like yourself just said. So count up all those animals killed on the meat production instead of acting like they only exist on plant based production.

Chickens and other animals eat each other out of necessity to survive, not for pleasure. Your chickens eat the bugs because they’re hungry and will starve if they don’t. Other wild animals the same. Also, other animals don’t have moral consideration in their actions like we do. We proclaim ourselves the superior species due to our intelectual, yet try to justify some of our actions as “but wild non intelligent animals do it”. And if the actions of wild animals justifies our actions, should it also justify killing and raping? Because they do that all the time.

I also found that waterfootprint website and its funny you choose the exact number that appealed to you the most because lets consider some numbers. Omnivores eat more beef than vegans eat nuts, as meat is most times a way bigger part in their diet than nuts are on a vegan diet, so the comparison isn’t exactly apples to apples. You also chose to omit that pulses, vegetables and cereals all used about a fifth of the water per protein gram. Not to mention that in the liter per calorie, beef goes to around 10x more resourceful. 

Almonds are more resourceful than most plants, I give you that, but don’t try the word shipped because the shipping itself is the lesser part of the whole process. Shipping food produces less than 10% of the emissions in pretty much every food. And “regenerative” agriculture beats almonds in where? Maybe water per protein (which humans eat too much off anyways and not enough fibre), but beef still produces more CO2 (about 13,78Kg per 1000 calories) than the average plant (most are under 2Kg per 1000 calories). More nutrition for your “buck”.",3,p9wdlq,19
hajtx2p,"You're fucking retarded dude. My cows don't eat feed, they fucking eat grass all day that has no fertilizer or water added. The soy you fucking eat is drenched in both and probably from petrochemical companies.

And now you're making a moral argument for your veganism, not environmental one, your morality is fucked up in my eyes and it is out of line for you to try to push your moral framework on me, typical vegan.

Nice side step talking about the bugs my animals eat and not all the animals churned up in a combine (not to mention the petro used to run said combine). A family of mice or quail getting churned up by a machine or the loss of habitat for wild turkey to make easy for a clear cut soy field is not comparable to the bugs my birds forage.

""Vegans easy less nuts than omnivores easy beef"" and now you're not even comparing people with the same macro nutrient diets and instead giving vegans a diet of less protein so their water consumption is lower. You cannot be objective. Just because vegans want to be weak bitches doesn't mean the rest of us do. I want to repair my muscles after I work or, so I need protein. I didn't cherry pick numbers, getting protein is the hardest thing for vegans and vegetarians, and nuts help that, so that's the main number I chose. 

Omg you legally know nothing about farming. MY COWS SEQUESTER CARBON AND MY WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE CARBON FOOT PRINT IN 10 YEARS. Y'all vegans are the worst part of this Evita movement because you have a religion you feel you have to preach. Right now you're fucking arguing with a farmer who can feed a family of 5 entirely in less than the ten acres I own. Go fucking find a real God damn factory farmer and stop pushing people away from this movement because you're such a bitch you can't bring yourself to butcher an animal like humans have done since we evolved.

If you actually care about the environment, go look up mark shepherds farm, or Greg Judy, or Paul wheaton, or Joel salatin. You probably haven't grown a calorie for yourself in your life.",-2,p9wdlq,20

ham9m1y,"So your idea is that we should trade the “industrialised” animal agriculture for the way you practice. Ok, let’s roll with it. Sustainability again, how do you plan to feed the word on “grass fed” beef? Beef is already the most land consuming animal product, and that’s with industrialisation of it. Take all those cows in the warehouses Oman’s put them on grass. You can’t, it’s not possible. 26% of the non ice surface of the earth is already being given to graving animals, an you want to increase that? You’d need to cover all available land on Earth and destroy even more land for that. We can’t, and we should be working towards freeing land to rewild and let biodiversity do its thing and nature sequester CO2. Also, the grass doesn’t get water but your cows still need to drink a bunch of water everyday. And the “bad soy” everyone makes out to be the cause of Amazonian deforestation is used for animal feed. Most soy used for human consumption is produced in Europe in more “sustainable” ways.

Tell me how my morality is fucked up. And moralism and environmentalism shouldn’t be an either or the other.

Once again acting like soy is the only thing out there in the world. Like I said, even if your cows don’t eat crops, I know they don’t need, most in animal agriculture are and, per my first point, you can’t feed the world on grass fed cows. We’d need another planet for it. So you either continue with the industries (not viable) or change the way we eat that consumes overall less water, land and CO2. (And I’ve debunked all those 3, don’t come again with water cause my first point still stands. We are researching into new technologies of farming like vertical farming which will reduce land usage immensely and reduce those accidental death on crops to 0 or near 0.

Like I said before, humans eat too much protein anyways, and you don’t need 200g a day (depending on your body and work, but over 90% of people don’t). I get over 100g daily easily and the only nuts I eat is peanut butter on a sandwich, which isn’t even a nut, it’s a legume. You forget the pulses I’ve mentioned before and most vegans eat a lot of beans and lentils, that I’ve shown use way less water than nuts and beef. Go tell vegan bodybuilders like Patrik Baboumian or athletes like Novak Djokovic that they’re weak bitches.

Graving cows don’t become carbon neutral. I can’t link you to a video and give you all the studies you want. The math presented by the literal meat industries always omit key links from the chain. And if you feed a family of 5 in that land, then I assume everything you eat must be from the and nothing has to be bought right? And yes, I’ve grown plenty of calories myself. I have a field on my backyard and grown a bunch of fruit and legumes there. My neighbour on one side grows chickens, the other side one grows goats. Both their field are easily 10 times larger than mine in length. Mine produces more food. Also, the goats are lovely and love to play with me, well, until they die.

ha3ugrs,"The reasons animal agriculture hasn't had to face the massive environmental regulation that it's long overdue for are lobbying and the public's lack of will to change habits.

Our current consumption of animal products is a major contributor to climate change,[\[1\]](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987) and climate change in turn is a risk to food security and human health.[\[2\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/)  Recognizing this fact, the USDA Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) decided to consider sustainability in their 2015 report to the USDA, stating that:

>...a diet higher in plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in calories and animal-based foods is more health promoting and is associated with less environmental impact than is the current U.S. diet. This pattern of eating can be achieved through a variety of dietary patterns, including the Healthy U.S.-style Pattern, the Healthy Mediterranean-style Pattern, and the Healthy Vegetarian Pattern. All of these dietary patterns are aligned with lower environmental impacts and provide options that can be adopted by the U.S. population.[\[3\]](https://health.gov/our-work/food-nutrition/previous-dietary-guidelines/2015/advisory-report)

In response, industry associations lobbied Senators to remove sustainability as a consideration from the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs).  In the end, the animal agriculture industry was successful in preventing sustainability's consideration in the 2015 DGAs, despite public support for its inclusion.[\[4\]](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/2015-dietary-guidelines-217438)[\[5\]](https://sydneyuniversitypress.com.au/products/128398)

In the EU, two industry associations (UECBV & CLITRAVI) lobbied in 2012 to become leading stakeholders in a public-private partnership coordinated by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to assess the best way to estimate the environmental performance of EU livestock.  In 2014, the UECBV got onto a project with the EU Commission for the ""development of a harmonised methodology for the calculation of the environmental footprint"" of meat products.\[6\]  What happened with these environmental projects?

>At the end of 2019 no scientific output had emerged from any of the previous partnerships beyond press releases and memorandums of positions.  In short, the strategy followed seems to merely replicate a common pattern: make great efforts to become a privileged partner in discussions on what has to be changed in order to prevent such change as much as possible by forcing one's narrative and interests.[\[7\]](https://sydneyuniversitypress.com.au/products/128398)

The UN, despite recognizing as early as 2006 that the animal agriculture industry was a major source of anthropogenic GHG emissions,[\[8\]](http://www.fao.org/3/a0701e/a0701e00.htm) didn't explicitly recommend plant-based diets as a solution until their 2019 report.[\[9\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/chapter/summary-for-policymakers/)  Even then, when given the opportunity to voice the findings of his report, the co-chair's message was weak:

>We don’t want to tell people what to eat ... but it would indeed be beneficial, for both climate and human health, if people in many rich countries consumed less meat, and if politics would create appropriate incentives to that effect.[\[10\]](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-02409-7)

It doesn't exactly communicate the magnitude and urgency of the issue.

Even NGOs with goals that would clearly benefit from a reduction in our consumption of animal products - such as Greenpeace, Sierra Club, or the World Wildlife Fund - do not explicitly oppose animal agriculture.  Why not?

>In an interview about the launching of his documentary *An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power*, \[Al\] Gore was asked why he did not put more emphasis on eating habits and on the consumption of animal products.  Gore, who according to himself has been vegan since 2012, provided two reasons for this: first, personal habits are very difficult to change and, second, any emphasis on animal products could be seen as an attack on the animal agriculture and food industry.  That is, he recognised that he did not emphasise *meat*\-eating so as to not bother big business and citizens.  We can infer from this that green NGOs and advocates are strongly reluctant to send messages that may expose the contradictions of society probably out of fear of losing support, which could severly damage their finances.  Thus, their denial is also essentially economically oriented.[\[7\]](https://sydneyuniversitypress.com.au/products/128398)

So there are a few reasons nobody is doing anything about animal agriculture when it comes to climate change.  Politicians are worried their constituents will get pissed off (especially if their district is a big producer of animal products) and not vote for them.  People don't want to change their habits.  Organizations that should be sounding the alarm are afraid of losing support, either financial or otherwise, by opposing animal agriculture.  And there is a very aggressive animal agriculture lobby that has been highly successful at running interference.

Hopefully we continue to see meat consumption decline around the world.  Animal agriculture is an environmental catastrophe that is going largely unaddressed, or at least significantly under-addressed.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (UN FAO) estimates that animal agriculture is responsible for approximately 14.5 percent of anthropogenic GHG emissions (in CO2 equivalent).[\[1\]](http://www.fao.org/3/i3437e/i3437e00.htm)  Other estimates suggest that animal agriculture could account for as much as 51 percent of all anthropogenic GHG emissions.[\[2\]](https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.12454)  Whatever the case, it is certain that animal agriculture is responsible for a significant share of our GHG emissions and reduction in this area is critical to reducing the effects of climate change.

Beyond GHG emissions, a 2018 meta-analysis in *Science* attempted to find the larger environmental cost of animal agriculture.  This study's data set covered approximately 38,700 farms from 119 countries and over 40 products which accounted for  approximately 90 percent of global protein and calorie consumption.  The study concluded that:

>Moving from current diets to a diet that excludes animal products...has transformative potential, reducing food’s land use by 3.1 (2.8 to 3.3) billion ha (a 76% reduction), including a 19% reduction in arable land; food’s GHG emissions by 6.6 (5.5 to 7.4) billion metric tons of CO2eq (a 49% reduction); acidification by 50% (45 to 54%); eutrophication by 49% (37 to 56%); and scarcity-weighted freshwater withdrawals by 19% (−5 to 32%) for a 2010 reference year.

And:

>We consider a second scenario where consumption of each animal product is halved by replacing production with above-median GHG emissions with vegetable equivalents. This achieves 71% of the previous scenario’s GHG reduction (a reduction of \~10.4 billion metric tons of CO2eq per year, including atmospheric CO2 removal by regrowing vegetation) and 67, 64, and 55% of the land use, acidification, and eutrophication reductions.[\[3\]](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987)

The results of this study prompted the lead researcher to remark that:

>A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use.[\[4\]](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth)

The study also found that beef was by far the most environmentally intense animal food product, in alignment with other studies.[\[5\]](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1402183111)

A 2010 report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) stated that:

>Impacts from agriculture are expected to increase substantially due to population growth, increasing consumption of animal products. Unlike fossil fuels, it is difficult to look for alternatives: people have to eat. A substantial reduction of impacts would only be possible with a substantial worldwide diet change, away from animal products.[\[6\]](https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/8501)

Despite the research showing that a significant move away from our current dietary habits (particularly those of developed nations with high meat consumption) is required to combat climate change, the issue regularly receives a rather soft response.  We see recommendations to implement one meat-free day per week, through statements from UN officials like Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Meat Free Monday and Meatless Monday campaigns.[\[7\]](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/07/food.foodanddrink)[\[8\]](https://www.meatfreemondays.com/)[\[9\]](https://www.mondaycampaigns.org/meatless-monday)  Although these are perhaps (in some cases) merely intended as starting points, this undersells the scale of action required.  An international commission was assembled, comprised of researchers in human health, agricultural, political, and environmental science to devise dietary guidelines that are optimized to meet human and planetary health requirements.  In their report, they determined that North America, for example, the average person consumed over six times their recommended annual consumption of red meat.[\[10\]](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31788-4)

We need most individuals to drastically cut their meat consumption.  While it's important to note that this may not be a possibility for every individual, depending on their living conditions, it is probably safe to assume that this is a reasonable, attainable goal for most people buying their food at a supermarket.

Furthermore, government action is required.  Governments provide billions of dollars annually to the animal agriculture industry in the form of subsidies.[\[11\]](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/taxpayers-oblivious-to-the-cost-of-farm-subsidies/article13055078/)[\[12\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/us-touts-fruit-and-vegetables-while-subsidizing-animals-that-become-meat/2011/08/22/gIQATFG5IL_story.html)  Yet our environmental outcomes are still terrible.

We need people to eat less meat.  Much less.  We can't be satisfied with one meat-free day a week, or just hoping that lab-grown meat arrives fast enough so we don't need to change our habits. Likely, the required change must be attained through some combination of drastically reducing subsidies for animal agriculture, subsidizing or incentivizing farmers to transition away from animal agriculture, and funding campaigns to encourage and/or incentivize the public to significantly lower their meat consumption.  But we need to start making some rather large strides now.

It's not just the cows themselves, it's the feed that goes into them, the clearing of land, etc. It's a problem with the whole system.

So passenger cars in US produced 777.5 tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases in 2018, out of a total 1,883.9 tonnes for the entire transportation sector. That's 41.27%.

Now, 41.27% out of the 28.2% of total GHG emissions by the transport sector gives us this wonderful result: **11.63% of all GHG US emissions are due to passenger cars**.

Now compare this to the 9.9% due to the whole agricultural sector or the 3.3% we can blame on beef cattle production.",0,p9wdlq,3

This is not strictly beef, but beef and dairy are the worst animal products for GHG emissions. So if we use the median value of 67%, and the value of agriculture as a whole being 10% of the US's emissions, then we find that a shift away from animal products could reduce the US's emissions from food by roughly 0.365 GT, or approximately all of the UK's combined emissions from all sectors.[[2]](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/each-countrys-share-co2-emissions)

Of course, neither solution prohibits the other. We can reduce emissions on transportation while reducing emissions from food production.

>Atmospheric impacts  
In addition to the direct heating effect and the normal feedbacks, the methane breaks down to carbon dioxide and water. This water is often above the tropopause where little water usually reaches. Ramanathan (1988)[99] notes that both water and ice clouds, when formed at cold lower stratospheric temperatures, are extremely efficient in enhancing the atmospheric greenhouse effect. He also notes that there is a distinct possibility that large increases in future methane may lead to a surface warming that increases nonlinearly with the methane concentration.   

&   
  
> Ozone layer  
Methane also affects the degradation of the ozone layer, when methane is transformed into water in the stratosphere. This process is enhanced by global warming, because warmer air holds more water vapor than colder air, so the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere increases as it is warmed by the greenhouse effect. Climate models also indicate that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane may enhance the transport of water into the stratosphere; though this is not fully understood.
